# Eclipse

A challenging custom difficulty with overhauled AI, enemies, tactics and more! Includes playerside balance overhaul.

### For First-timers
Your stats WILL be reset, this mod uses a different savefile, but your original savefile will be safe.

In order to max progression, go into:
1.  Settings
2.  Advanced
3.  Max Account Progression

**DO NOT RELOAD BLT IN GAME TO REMOVE/ADD THE MOD**<br/>
**RESTART THE GAME IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE IT**<br/>
**NOT RESTARTING THE GAME WILL CAUSE YOUR SAVEFILE TO CORRUPT**<br/>
