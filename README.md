# "What if Goldfarb suddenly came back?" twist to Payday
**Eclipse is a complete Payday 2 overhaul that aims to provide early-payday hardcore gameplay feel while adapting it for modern age.**

**NOTE: Launching the game for the first time after installing the mod will put you on a new empty savefile. Uninstalling the mod will put you back on your vanilla savefile. If you want to skip grinding on the new savefile there is a max progression button next to reset progress button in options. It's not recommended to try to transfer your vanilla savefile into this mod as that can lead to crashes and inconsistencies.**

**Compatibility & Networking** 
There is a list of incompatible mods that you will be asked to disable upon starting up the game in case you have one of them installed.
Due to the extent of gameplay changes Eclipse uses **its own matchmaking key** so you will only be able to play with those who have the mod.

⠀

**General list of changes**
-  **Weapons & Gunplay**
Weapons have undergone a huge overhaul in order to make them feel unique, from simple stat tweaks to some weapons changing their slots in your arsenal completely. Pretty much every weapon has a certain use case now. Complete rework of base recoil system and introducing recoil patterns for some weapons. No more laserbeam guns with no recoil!
⠀
- **Skilltrees & Perk Decks**
A vast majority of powertrip skills / perk decks were nerfed while weaker and less interesting skills have seen a buff.
Additionally featuring some completely new effects!

⠀
- **Difficulties & Scaling**
Eclipse removes 2 difficulties from the rotation as they're really pointless and do absolutely nothing other than bloat the game.
More gameplay aspects use scaling which makes for a better difficulty curve: ai tickrate, spawnrates, drama gained, bulldozer armor, etc.
Player count is also actively used for scaling, unlike vanilla, in order to make solo scenarios feel fair without making certain things (like bulldozer armor) trivial to deal with in a 4-man crew.
Pro Jobs are seeing a return as a replacement for the OD modifier with more impactful and unique modifiers: friendly fire, affecting team AI count, PoNR, more punishing down system.
Grace period scales with difficulty.
⠀
- **Enemies**
[Streamlined Heisting](https://modworkshop.net/mod/29713)'s AI is used as a framework for this mod's AI.
No more difficulty health scaling - the very same FBI SWAT won't just magically become tankier because of an additional skull in the difficulty selection. 
Instead difficulty health scaling is done through tougher factions gradually replacing weaker ones as the difficulty increases.
Enemies don't feel unsatisafyingly bulletspongy anymore - say "NO" to forced damage skills on higher difficulties!
Damage that enemies deal is kept at sensible levels. Begone 225 no falloff.
Hostage Rescue Teams / shotgunners see a return and brand new enemies enter the field on Eclipse difficulty.

⠀
- **Full Force Onslaught**
As Pro Jobs bring Point of No Return into frequent use, PoNR mechanic itself has been reworked completely.
When PoNR timer runs out the heist isn't instantly failed. 
Instead the game enters a Full Force Onslaught state with massively bumped heist difficulty: prolonged assaults, more complex spawngroup compositions, higher spawnrates, etc.
Expect an unwanted guest when you enter FFO while playing on Eclipse difficulty...

**And much more!**

⠀
**Potentially / Frequently asked questions**
- Q: I only have 2(or 1) Team AI, is it intended? A: Yes.
- Q: I'm seeing "ERROR: [insert string]" instead of proper text, why? A: You don't have Beardlib installed.
- Q: Does this work with custom weapons? A: They're technically functional but they won't be balanced for this mod.
- Q: Does this work with [insert name of a rebalance / overhaul]? A: Most definitely not, and even if it would be technically functional, it'll still cause unintentional behavior.
- will add more if i see more stuff pop up
